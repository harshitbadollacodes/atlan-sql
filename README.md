## Walkthrough Video

## Tech: Libraries and framework

- React Js library for Frontend
- Styled Components for CSS.

## Page Load Time and Optimisation

- Used lighthouse from the chrome dev tools and the performance score is 100ðŸ˜„
- Lazy loaded components which are not required in the initial page load.
- Used WebP image format.
- Reusable code wherever possible so that DRY principle is maintained.
- Used least dependencies for creating the whole app thereby leading to smaller js bundles.
- Hosted on Vercel which provides CDN and caching benefits and also every code change pushed to github triggers an automatic deployment. Other benefits are SSL certificate ensuring that application is served over HTTPS.
